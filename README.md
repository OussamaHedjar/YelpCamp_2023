# YelpCamp_2023
The YelpCamp project was a code-along and was instructed by Colt Steele and supervised by Zarko, and Akshay in any case of error or problem, whom I am thankful for all of their hard work and help.

My version differs slightly from the original one, and this is because since Colt posted the videos for building the web application from scratch some packages have changed several features, which led me to look for solutions and thankfully I found some of them in the discussion section in the course or notes by Zarko.

I want to point out that I also made some slight changes to the design as I thought they suited my view.
For styling, I relied on Bootstrap 5 a tool that made things very easy for me regarding content display and organization.

Another thing to point out is that I used the Render service to host my version of Yelp Camp.

YelpCamp can add Campgrounds, Users, and Reviews. It can also delete the Campgrounds and their associated reviews, or just the Reviews. It can also edit the Campgrounds and its data. 

Authentication and Authorization are implemented to a level.

The main page named Campgrounds uses Mapbox API to render a map of all the campgrounds around the US. As well as a map of every existing Campground. 

Any Images that are imported to the YelpCamp will be stored in Cloudinary and will be fetched using Cloudinary API anytime the user is on the Campgrounds page or any Campground view page.


Again, I want to thank Colt Steele, Zarko, Akshay, and all of those in Udemy who helped in any way to give such an amazing journey.
